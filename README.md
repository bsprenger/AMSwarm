# AMSwarm 2.0
## Overview
AMSwarm 2.0 is a high-speed drone swarm trajectory planner that improves upon the original [AMSwarm](https://github.com/utiasDSL/AMSwarm) implementation (and associated [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04856)).

The core of AMSwarm 2.0 is written in C++, using the Eigen linear algebra library for high-speed, real-time suitable code. We also provide an easy to use Python wrapper that allows for seamless integration to existing simulators such as [gym-pybullet-drones](https://github.com/utiasDSL/gym-pybullet-drones).

This implementation features several key differences from the original AMSwarm formulation:
- **Temporal waypoint tracking**: the objective of this implementation is to track waypoints (guarantee arrival at waypoints at specific times) instead of minimizing distance to a goal position
- **Incorporation of dynamics model**: this implementation makes use of identified dynamics model matrices to more accurately predict trajectories (and avoid collisions)
- **Optimized Alternating-Minimization (AM) algorithm**: we improve upon the previous AM algorithm, eliminating the need for slow trigonometric operations
- **Distribution of drone avoidance responsibilities**: we distribute avoidance responsibilities among drones, reducing the average collision constraints in the optimization problem by 1/2.
- **Improved code structure and implementation**: this implementation abstracts out the underlying AM algorithm from the swarm planning problem, making it easier to adapt the algorithms to your own use cases.

## Key Enhancements

- **Temporal Waypoint Tracking**: Targets precise arrival times at waypoints, optimizing for temporal accuracy.
- **Dynamics Model Incorporation**: Uses identified dynamics models for enhanced trajectory prediction and collision avoidance.
- **Optimized AM Algorithm**: Improves the Alternating-Minimization algorithm for greater efficiency, completely eliminating slow trigonometric operations.
- **Distributed Avoidance Responsibilities**: Distributes avoidance tasks among drones to reduce collision constraints by half.
- **Improved Code Structure**: Abstracts the AM algorithm for easier adaptation and customization to various use cases.

# Build instructions

## Prerequisites

Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 with Python 3.8. Requirements include:

- CMake (>=3.12)
- C++ compiler with OpenMP support
- [pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing.html) (Note: depending on your system, you may need to install the pybind11-global option for CMake visibility)

## Installing AMSwarm
1. Clone the AMSwarm repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/bsprenger/AMSwarm.git
```
2. Navigate to the cloned directory and install with pip:
```
pip install .
```
This will automatically compile the C++ code and install the Python module in the appropriate location for your Python installation.

# Using AMSwarm

You can use AMSwarm in C++ by including the appropriate headers in your project and linking against the compiled library. For Python usage, after installation, import the `amswarm` module in your scripts:

```
import amswarm
```

Refer to the examples provided in the `examples/python` directory for comprehensive usage scenarios.
